        #### Nightingale is a behavioral therapy tech startup backed by<br>Y-Combinator and Stanford’s StartX.
        
        The founders are close friends of mine and I joined up with them during my senior year of college to help them with product design remotely.
        
        Nightingale presents a unique challenge in that the target users are behavioral therapists, staff, and clinical directors (and not college students). So the design process involves learning a lot about those users and their use cases. It is also my first foray into healthcare tech, which has it’s own design and product constraints.

        #### This is what the old Nightingale navigation looked like when you logged into the site. 

        Nightingale is organized by clients, staff, and clinics. Within each of those verticals, is a wealth of data about each (graphs, goals, comments, etc). 
        
        We knew that when therapists and clinical directors are using Nightingale they are doing so to look at either a specific client, staff member, or location. They are not “browsing,” they have a specific thing they want to look at.

        ## I wanted the users to be able to find the specific client, staff, or location they logged on to find as quickly as possible.

        ### All-purpose search bar, with updating results below

        Therapists and directors know exactly who or what they are looking for when they sign in to Nightingale. Searching that person’s name will refine the list under the search bar to show results that match the search.

        ### Easily browse clients and search results
        
        Therapists can skip to clients, staff, parents, and locations initially or in thier search results. This is very helpful when it comes to bigger clinics with multiple locations. Therapists can also easily add clients, etc., with the plus button.

        ### Data Visualization before
        
        This is what the old behavioral journal looked like. It showed show a client’s therapy data ((that’s been collected through the Nightingale mobile app) in a very stark and blank manner that was hard to quickly interpret.

        ### Challenges

        Therapists to set goals for therapy sessions. They also to track these goals over time by weeks and months. They wanted daily, weekly, and monthly goals for of the therapy data for each patient. So in designing the new journal, I had to design ways to visualize these goals in a daily, weekly, and monthly view.

        ### What’s important
        
        80% of the time therapists are simply skimming days, weeks, or months to see if certain clients have met their respective goals. So we wanted to make goals, the focus of the journal, with an emphasis on easy ways to quickly digest goal information

        ### Exploration

        These are a few of some early explorations I did experimenting with showing the therapy progress towards goals. Originally I wanted something very clean and simple.

        ### Early mockups

        Nightingale therapists need a quick way to visually display thier client’s progress over time. They use graphs to do so because graphs are easily interpreted by parents, staff, and directors. Below are a few early mockups I did for the Nightingale graph-making tool.

        ### Easily changing the time interval shown

        Therapists wanted to be able to manipulate the date range quickly.

        ### View multiple goals from different trackers
        
        Therapists need to be able to show multiple goals for different trackers on one graph.

        ## I designed the final version with these two criteria on mind, while making an effort to keep the interface clean and intuitive.

        ## It payed off. A few days after the graphing tool went live, Nightingale started receiving emails like this.
