        #### Nightingale is a behavioral therapy tech startup backed by<br>Y-Combinator and Stanford’s StartX.
        
        Nightingale presented a unique challenge to me, in that the target users are behavioral therapists, clinical directors, and staff, and not college students. As this was my first venture into healthcare tech—with it’s own design and product parameters and constraints—the design process involved educating myself regarding users and their use cases.

        #### This is what the old Nightingale navigation looked like when you logged into the site.

        Nightingale is organized by clients, staff, and clinics. Within each of those verticals, is a wealth of data about each (graphs, goals, comments, etc). 
        
        When therapists and clinical directors use Nightingale, they are specifically looking at a particular client, staff member, or location. They are not “browsing.”

        ## I wanted the users to be able to find that specific client, staff, or location as quickly as possible upon login.

        ### All-purpose search bar, with updating results below

        Therapists and directors know exactly who or what they are looking for when they sign in to Nightingale. Searching that person’s name will refine the list under the search bar to show results that match the search.

        ### Easily browse clients and search results
        
        Therapists can skip to clients, staff, parents, and locations initially or in their search results. This is extremely helpful when it comes to bigger clinics with multiple locations. Therapists can also easily add clients, etc., with the plus button.

        ### Data Visualization before
        
        This is what the old behavioral journal looked like. It’s design portrays the client’s therapy data that’s been collected through the Nightingale mobile app, in a stark manner that was difficult to interpret quickly.

        ### Challenges

        There was a need for a journal that could accurately track and display the daily, weekly, and monthly therapy goals for each patient over time. So in designing the new journal, I had to come up with ways to visualize these goals in a daily, weekly, and monthly view.

        ### What’s important
        
        80% of the time, therapists are simply skimming days, weeks, or months to see if certain clients have met their respective goals. In the redesign, we wanted to make goals the focus of the journal, with an emphasis on easy ways to quickly digest the goal information.

        ### Exploration

        Here are some early explorations experimenting with showing the therapy progress toward the goal. Originally I wanted something very clean and simple.

        ### Early mockups

        Nightingale therapists need a quick way to visually display a client’s progress over time. They use graphs to do so because graphs are easily interpreted by parents, staff, and directors. Below are a few early mockups I did for the Nightingale graph-making tool.

        ### Easily changing the time interval shown

        Therapists wanted to be able to manipulate the date range quickly.

        ### View multiple goals from different trackers
        
        Therapists need to be able to show multiple goals for different trackers on one graph.

        ## I designed the final version with these two criteria in mind, while making an effort to keep the interface clean and intuitive.

        ## It payed off. A few days after the graphing tool went live, Nightingale started receiving emails like this.
