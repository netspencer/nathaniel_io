        #### I found that myself and my fellow classmates had so much freetime in college.
        
        We had class, sports, club meetings, and meals spread out all over the day, with time intervals of 20 minutes to 2 hours in between.
        
        I wanted to make something that would help kids accomplish something meaningful to them in these chunks of free time (rather than browse Facebook for an hour).

        ### That was a big idea

        In developing this larger idea, I came across a smaller one that would help more people and be easier for four college students to build

        ### Small time chunks, more users
        
        College students are unique in that they have large chunks of free time. However, most working adults and teens have smaller bits of free time in the 1-20 minute range.

        ### Two more hours in a day

        These small time chunks add up to about two hours a waking-day, usually spent doing nothing. People are busy. Giving busy people two more hours of productivity in their day felt like a solution worth chasing.

        ### The 24 hour prototype

        So for a hackathon, I organized a team to build an iphone app where you would enter in the amount of time you had, and the app would show you articles that would take that relative amount of time to read.

        ### Challenge of serving relevant content
        
        The primary challenge we encountered when beta-testing Spare was that it’s “cool” to serve up articles based on time, but if that content isn’t more interesting or relevant than Twitter or Facebook’s then nobody will use our app. Our potential pivot was to pull content from your Facebook/Twitter feed and filter it by time.
