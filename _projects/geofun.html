        ### Group Dinners & Events App

        For HackMIT, some friends and I set out to create an app to assist in arranging group dinners and hangouts. Often, in organizing these group activities, no one is ever on time.

        ### Friends’ ETA’s are helpful
        
        Dozens of text messages questioning “Where are you?,” “What’s your ETA?,” “Should I get a table?,” or “When will you be here?” are parried back and forth.

        ### People can’t always find eachother

        Furthermore, friends would often call and ask again for the location of where we were meeting.

        ## After quickly prototyping the above app, we re-thought through the UX and figured:

        **1.** Nobody would download an app JUST to do this (“Find My Friends” already exists).

        **2.** The only person who really had a pain point was the event planner (or the first person to the meeting location).

        **3.** People who are late aren’t going to download an app or do much of anything as they are likely rushing.

        ## So we built it to be browser-based:

        - centered

        ### A simple web app

        We found this to be a much smoother process. You use the app when you want to, and it is not necessary to download anything.

        ### The responding user only need to tap a text link to share their location

        We used Twilio to do all the location sharing via texts, so the responding user simply receives a text link saying, “Josh wants to know your ETA! Share it with Josh?”
