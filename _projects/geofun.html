        ### Group Dinners & Events App

        For HackMIT, some friends and I set out to create an app for group dinners and hangouts. We often organized such group events and meetings and found that nobody was ever on time.

        ### Friends’ ETA’s are helpful
        
        When figuring out group dinners we would all end up sending out multiple texts of, “Where are you?” “What’s your ETA?” “Should I get a table?” “When will you be here?”

        ### People can’t always find eachother

        Furthermore, friends would always call and ask where I was, “I can’t find the starbucks we’re supposed to meet at, where are you?”

        ## After quickly prototyping the above app, we re-thought through the UX and figured:

        **1.** Nobody would download an app JUST to do this (find friends exists)

        **2.** The only person who really had a pain point was event planner (or the first person to the restaurant)

        **3.** People who are late aren’t going to download an app or do much of anything (they are likely rushing)

        ## So we built it to be browser-based:

        ### One-step web app

        We found this to be a much smoother process. You use the app when you want to, and you don’t have to download anything.

        ### The responding user only need to tap a text link to share thier location

        We used twilio to do all the location sharing via texts, so the responding user simply recieves a text link saying, “Josh wants to know your ETA! Share it with Josh?”
