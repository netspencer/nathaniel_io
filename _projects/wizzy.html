        #### Video is an underutilized medium because good videos are very hard to create on a mobile phone.
        
        It’s easy to add a filter and make a picture look good. Videos, however, are a much richer media that incorporate sound and motion, so it is much harder to make them entertaining. 
        
        What if a video app was based around messaging (snapchat-esque)? What if the music was completely random, i.e. not up to the user?

        What if the user had to send the video to a friend before they could even hear the random song on thier video, there incentivizing sharing and incorporation a new emotion in social - surprise.

        ## Just shoot a video, add optional effects like slomo, filters, and text, select friends to receive your creation, and Wizzy will magically add the perfect soundtrack.

        ### Hint: turn your sound on :)

        ### Surprise!

        Wizzy is unique because the sender is surprised by what song is on their video. The reciever is also suprised because they know their friend has no control over the song choice. No other apps do this meaningfully like Wizzy.

        ### Speed
        
        The user doesn’t have to spend time debating or finding a song, like Instagram did for pictures, Wizzy makes making an entertaining video doable in a few taps.

        ### Messaging vs. feed

        We’re still exploring which would be best, but we released a messaging focused product because these are such quick and dirty videos, perhaps not meant for feed sharing. I think music makes video messaging more interesting. Also random music for feed-sharing could be difficult because the videos are attached to the user’s personal brand.

        ## Onboarding

        Wizzy wants acess to your contacts and notifications, so we ask you in the sign-up process. Though, if you tap skip to either of these in the sign-up process - Wizzy will ask you again contextually within the app (In the sign-up process we don’t bring up the native iOS accept/deny access module unless you tap allow.)

        ## Wizzes don’t last forever

        Received Wizzes last for 24 hours. The sender can download a Wiz to their camera roll if it is especially good. I made this decision because we want wizzes to sent often and I don’t want the sender to worry about thier Wizzes coming back to haunt them later in life. Long story short: feel free to Wiz often and to Wiz drunk. They’ll be wiped in 24 hours.

        ## Toggle camera effects back and forth while recording

        We used a ‘tap to record’ and ‘tap to stop’ recording method rather than a ‘hold to record’ button. We did so in order for users to be able to toggle on and off selfie cam, flash, and slomo. We figured (and found) that this would make videos more interesing in general.

        ### More than a toy

        A completely random song is great, but after beta-releasing Wizzy in the app store and watching how 1500 people used it the first few weeks (especially an entire highschool in Chicago) we learned a few things. Most importanly we realized that, if we wanted Wizzy to be more than a toy, we needed to make it easier for people to communicate or “messages.”

        ### Song filters & text

        I wanted to keep Wizzy lightweight and retain its aspect of surprise. I kept that in mind when we added the ability to add text and song filters. For now, song filters are simply six or seven emotional song categories. Such as “Thugged out,” (adds a random gangster rap song to your video) or “Flirty,” (adds a random pop-r&b song). These features make it easier to communicate a message or emotion in your video.

        ### Preserving speed

        In order to preserve the creation speed the initial release version had, I set the filter automatically to “random” and you have to tap the filter icon to choose a different filter. Adding text is like Snapchat, simply a screentap. So if a user wants to rush though and send a quick video, they can easily do so.

        ### Sending a video

        The send screen includes ‘best friends’ and ‘recents’ at the top.  Bestfriends are an auto-generated list of people you wiz the most. These two auto-generated lists make sharing a Wiz with the people who want as quick as possible.

        ### Loading the video

        I designed an indicator of the percentage of your video that has been loaded once you’ve sent it in order to show that if it is taking awhile, nothing is broken. To make this waiting screen delightful, I added a soundwave animation and a random pull-quote from popular song lyrics.

        ### Viewing your own video

        When viewing your own video, you can easily navigate to your inbox, download your video, or share it to your social networks if its especially good.

        ## Designing the inbox

        Received videos are organized by friend thumbnails, when a friend sends you a new video - that friends stack of videos bubbles to the top of your inbox. You can then side swipe within the viewer to watch that sender’s other unwatched/watched videos.

        ## Grid view vs. list view

        I chose a grid view, because Wizzes are organized by user (in stacks). The argument for a list view was that Wizzy is message-based (and a list view makes more sense for messaging). Thought that may be true, I believe Wizzes are a not quite messages and not quite feed videos, and they made more sense to be shown in a grid.

        ## Showing new wizzes

        I differentiated new wizzes from watched wizzes by making watched wizzes black and white and new unwatched wizzes in color. I also added a blue tab to new wizzes further indicate thier newness.

        The Wizzy team at the end of the Greylock Hackathon. From right: James Ruben, Jonah Grant, Brendan Ryan, and Nathaniel Hajian. We were one of 30 teams accepted to hack. We prototyped Wizzy at Greylock and ended up placing top 10 and demoing to hundreds of people.

        During the live demo, we took a Wiz of the judges and displayed it on a projector - the song that played (over the loudspeakers in fron of hundreds of people) on the video? “I Just Had Sex,” by the Lonely Island. It was perfect.
