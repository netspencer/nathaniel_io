        A group of friends and I wanted to create an app that our non-technical friends would use at school. We wanted to build something people would use at parties, sports games, and restaurants. 
        
        I always found myself sharing photos from parties the night before with my fraternity brothers the next morning. These photos didn’t belong on Facebook or Instagram, so I shared them with people them via my camera roll. 
        
        These photos didn’t necessarily belong on my camera roll, because I would never look at these blurry party photos again. However, they certainly were memories.

        Experiencing a photo taken at a certain location, when you are actually at that location, is interesting and makes that photo more meaningful and relevant.

        ### Marko is a “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” app.

        All content is public. You take a picture or leave a note  on Marko and that ‘mark’ is locked to that location and only viewable by other users if they are at that location.

        ### Giving text and photos equal weight
 
        I wanted to weigh text and pictures equally in the capture UI so the app wouldn’t push users one way or another. I also wanted to keep the app simple and make the action of ‘leaving a mark’ doable in two taps, as these photos and texts were supposed to be a little more raw and resemble quick thoughts or moments at locations.

        ### Facebook friends

        I was curious as to whether public content or content from friends would be more interesting to the user. I thought both were and when launching, there would not be enough content from just your facebook friends, so I included both.
