        #### I spent my most recent summer at Facebook. I worked on the Growth Design team to reach the next billion.
        
        During my time there, I organized intern-only design crits, learned Quartz Composer from the best, and explored new ways to access Facebook (among other things :).
        
        My proudest moment of the summer was when a few friends and I placed in a company-wide hackathon and were given the opporunity to personally present our live-demo and prototype to Mark Zuckerberg and top Facebook executives.

        #### While there I made an effort to become comfortable with Quartz Composer and Facebook Origami.
        
        Quartz is a prototyping tool that many FB designers use to rapidly prototype products, animations, and interactions. 
        
        I even hacked together a Quartz-Composer prototype that would recognize a user’s face with dots. Here’s a video of me playing with my prototype.
