        #### I spent last summer at Facebook working on the Growth Design team to reach the next billion.
        
        During my time there, I organized intern-only design critiques, learned to prototype with Quartz Composer, developed a formal design process, and learned to look at a problem from multiple angles.
        
        My proudest moment of the summer was the opportunity to personally present to Mark Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives, a demo of a prototype that myself and a group of three friends created at a FB company-wide hackathon.

        #### I even hacked together a Quartz-Composer prototype that would recognize a user’s face with dots. Here’s a video of me playing with my prototype.
