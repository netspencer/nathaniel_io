  Hello, I'm Nate.

  I’m an aspiring product designer. I became interested in technology and design my sophomore year of college - and it’s been a pretty crazy ride since then. Below is some of my work.

        #### I come up with, design and launch mobile/web products.

        The entire process of crafting, molding, and iterating on an idea excites me. I enjoy bringing these ideas to life with technology and putting together teams to launch them into the world. When it comes to working with others, I enjoy being a bit out of my league. Email me at 
        [nathanielhajian@gmail.com](mailto:nathanielhajian@gmail.com).

        I’m currently a senior at Tufts University (Graduating in May 2015) majoring in political science, media studies, and studio art. When I’m not busy pondering comparative politics of the Middle East, I design apps and invest as a partner with [DormRoomFund](http://dormroomfund.com).

        I spent my most recent summer as product design intern at Facebook and before that I had the privilege to work with the fine folks over at 
        [Robin](https://robinpowered.com). I like dark beer and football.
