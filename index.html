  Hello, I'm Nate.

  I’m an aspiring product designer. I became interested in technology and design my sophomore year of college - and it’s been a pretty crazy ride since then. Below is some of my work.

        #### I come up with, design and launch mobile/web products.

        I live for the entire process of noticing a problem, coming up with a product to solve it, designing it, and launching that solution into the world. When it comes to design and product teams, I enjoy being a bit out of my league.

        ### Get in touch.

        I’m currently a senior at Tufts University (Graduating in May 2015) majoring in political science, media studies, and studio art. When I’m not busy pondering comparative politics of the Middle East, I design apps and invest as a partner with DormRoomFund.

        I spent my most recent summer as product design intern at Facebook and before that I had the privilege to work with the fine folks over at Robin. I like dark beer and football.
